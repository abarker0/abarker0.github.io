                        This antivirus research project was done as part of one of UMD's ACES courses. Our team studied the impact of antiviruses
                        and antivirus warning banners on attacker behavior by creating four SSH-vulnerable honeypots. This was implemented by creating
                        Linux containers hosted on an ACES virtual machine and using a JavaScript Man-In-The-Middle client to connect attackers to
                        the honeypot after a few password attempts.

                        This model is a linear regression prediction model created using Python and pandas. Using data from 27,000 Steam games, we

                        CherryBot is a Discord bot created using Python, the asyncio library, and the Discord.py API. It receives
                        user input by sending messages to the bot, which are then processed asynchronously and sends a message back to the user.
                        This allows multiple different servers to interact with one running instance of the bot.
