                    <p>
                        This antivirus research project was done as part of UMD's ACES program. Our team studied the impact of antiviruses
                        and antivirus warning banners on attacker behavior by creating four SSH-vulnerable honeypots. This was implemented by creating
                        Linux containers hosted on an ACES virtual machine and using a JavaScript Man-In-The-Middle client to connect attackers to
                        the honeypot after a few password attempts. We then analyzed our results using Python and the Pandas library.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Details:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hypothesis: the actual or announced presence of an antivirus would decrease attacker interaction with the honeypot</li>
                            <li>Hosted four different containers on virtual Linux machine as part of ACES lab</li>
                            <li>Captured attacker IPs, commands entered, and preserved sessions for attackers to return within a 4 hour window</li>
                            <li>Automated attack detection, attacker entry, honeypot recycling, and honeypot redeployment via Bash scripting</li>
                            <li>Integrated Discord webhook to receive live notifications on attacks and honeypot status</li>
                            <li>Analyzed data collected, finding a statistical significant difference in the commands attackers used between honeypots</li>
                            <li>Surprisingly, our hypothesis was incorrect, as attackers executed more serious commands on the honeypots with a banner or antivirus</li>

                    <p>
                        This model is a multiclass classification decision tree created using Python, the Pandas library, and Microsoft's LightGBM framework.
                        Using data from 27,000 Steam games, we cleaned the data, performed statistical analysis, and applied the classification model to predict
                        a new game's expected number of sales using features such as publisher, game genre, price, and more.

                            <li>Performed ANOVA test on game publishers' positive rating proportions, finding the mean proportion differs significantly between them.</li>
                            <li>Performed chi-squared test on price category vs. sales, finding that games with prices under $1 or above $10 have significantly higher sales counts</li>
                            <li>Used Pearson Correlation on median playtime and positive rating proportion, finding a very weak correlation between them</li>
                            <li>Implemented a LightGBM multiclass classification decision tree model to predict a Steam game's sales count category (Low, Low-Medium, Medium, Medium-High, High) with 91% accuracy</li>
                            <li>Found that total ratings, positive rating proportion, and price have the largest impact on a game's number of sales</li>
                            <li>Visualized trained decision tree and pathway for specific game</li>
